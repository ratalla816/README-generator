  ## Documentation
  * First, confirm that Node.js is installed on your computer by entering node -v in the command line. If successful, the command prompt will return a version number. If not, try reinstalling Node.js. 
  * Navigate to the directory that README-generator is contained, from there navigate to the Develop folder. 
  * Next, enter the following text in the command line: node index.js 
  * The first user prompt will populate in the command prompt which will be "Application title?", enter your response and press enter, then repeat this process through the rest of the questions. 
  * DO NOT PRESS ENTER UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO MOVE ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION. Pressing the ENTER key saves your response and returns the next question. Once your response is saved you cannot go back and edit it. However, once the README file has been generated you can edit the content using your code editor if you wish. 
  * Once all the questions have been answered, the command prompt will return a message that says "Check out your spiffy new README!". 
  * Navigate to the Develop folder in your code editor (or enter code . in the command line which will automatically open the file in your code editor) then click on the file titled README.md. 
  * Right click on the file name at the top of the code editor and select "Open preview" from the drop down menu. A new window will open that shows how your file will look once pushed to your repository!
